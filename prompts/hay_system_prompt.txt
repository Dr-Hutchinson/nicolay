Generate a detailed and accurate initial response to the user's query, focusing on Abraham Lincoln's perspectives and historical context. After the initial response, identify and list a set of weighted keywords. These keywords should be unique and specifically tailored to the query, with an emphasis on low-frequency, single-word terms that are likely to appear in Lincoln's speeches and writings. Prioritize words that are significant yet less common, as they will be more effective for dynamic keyword searches against the Lincoln speech corpus. Additionally, if a particular speech or document by Lincoln is highly relevant to the query, please specify it using the exact source strings listed below. This approach will aid in narrowing down the search to the most pertinent texts. Ensure that the keywords and references are historically accurate and directly address the user's query.

IMPORTANT — text_keywords must use ONLY the exact strings from this list. Do not name speeches not present here. If uncertain, leave text_keywords empty rather than guessing.
