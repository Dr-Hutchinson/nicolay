You will be given a user query, an initial answer from a retrieval model, and a list of five retrieved passages from Abraham Lincoln's speeches. Each passage includes a Text ID, Source, Full Text excerpt, and Relevance Score. Generate a structured chain-of-thought response in the following JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"User Query Analysis\": {\n    \"synthesis_assessment\": \"Classify the synthesis task type and identify the primary reasoning challenge: (1) Direct Synthesis — one passage clearly answers the query; (2) Multi-Passage Synthesis — 2-3 passages contribute complementary evidence; (3) Absence/Partial Hit — no passage directly answers; evidence is indirect, sparse, or absent; (4) Historiographical Framing — passages support competing interpretations; surface both without premature resolution; (5) Tone Transfer / Epistemic Calibration — query involves sensitive topics (race, citizenship, colonization, violence) requiring careful framing and source-grounded restraint. State which type applies and why, based on the relevance scores and content of the retrieved passages.\",\n    \"Query Intent\": \"An analysis of what information the user is seeking.\",\n    \"Historical Context\": \"Brief context situating the query in Lincoln's era and corpus.\"\n  },\n  \"Initial Answer Review\": {\n    \"Answer Evaluation\": \"Evaluate the initial answer's accuracy and completeness against the retrieved evidence. Where the initial answer diverges from or oversimplifies what the corpus shows, flag this explicitly.\",\n    \"Quote Integration Points\": \"Identify where direct corpus quotes would strengthen or correct the initial answer.\"\n  },\n  \"Match Analysis\": {\n    \"RerankedMatch1\": {\n      \"Text ID\": \"text_id value\",\n      \"Source\": \"source string\",\n      \"Summary\": \"Brief summary of this match's relation to the query.\",\n      \"Key Quote\": \"The most analytically relevant excerpt from the Full Text for this query.\",\n      \"Historical Context\": \"Contextual information situating this passage in Lincoln's era.\",\n      \"Relevance Assessment\": \"High, Medium, or Low — with one sentence of justification.\"\n    },\n    \"RerankedMatch2\": {\"Text ID\": \"...\", \"Source\": \"...\", \"Summary\": \"...\", \"Key Quote\": \"...\", \"Historical Context\": \"...\", \"Relevance Assessment\": \"...\"},\n    \"RerankedMatch3\": {\"Text ID\": \"...\", \"Source\": \"...\", \"Summary\": \"...\", \"Key Quote\": \"...\", \"Historical Context\": \"...\", \"Relevance Assessment\": \"...\"},\n    \"RerankedMatch4\": {\"Text ID\": \"...\", \"Source\": \"...\", \"Summary\": \"...\", \"Key Quote\": \"...\", \"Historical Context\": \"...\", \"Relevance Assessment\": \"...\"},\n    \"RerankedMatch5\": {\"Text ID\": \"...\", \"Source\": \"...\", \"Summary\": \"...\", \"Key Quote\": \"...\", \"Historical Context\": \"...\", \"Relevance Assessment\": \"...\"}\n  },\n  \"Meta Analysis\": {\n    \"Strategy for Response Composition\": {\n      \"Match1\": \"How Match1 content contributes to the response.\",\n      \"Match2\": \"How Match2 content contributes, or why it is discounted.\",\n      \"Match3\": \"How Match3 content contributes, or why it is discounted.\",\n      \"Match4\": \"How Match4 content contributes, or why it is discounted/excluded.\",\n      \"Match5\": \"How Match5 content contributes, or why it is discounted/excluded.\"\n    },\n    \"Synthesis\": \"The integrated argument across contributing matches. Where evidence is absent or contradictory, state this rather than papering over it.\"\n  },\n  \"FinalAnswer\": {\n    \"Text\": \"A well-written response incorporating relevant quotes with parenthetical citations.
