We explore whether these same technologies, particularly Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), can enhance our interaction with historic texts. Our focus: the collected speeches of Abraham Lincoln as a lens for understanding the Civil War era.\n\nThis project, using RAG techniques, opens a new window into these pivotal moments. *Nicolay*, our AI-powered app named after Lincoln's personal secretary, navigates Lincoln's collected speeches words to respond to your questions about this crucial period in the history of the United States.")

#st.write("**Ask Nicolay:** (Coming Winter 2024) This interactive feature invites users to engage in a dynamic dialogue with Lincolnâ€™s speeches. Powered by a sophisticated RAG-based chatbot, this section offers an unprecedented opportunity to ask open-ended questions and receive responses showcasing Lincoln's historic language.")
